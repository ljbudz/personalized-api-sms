# personalized-api-sms

Makes API calls to OpenWeather (requires account) and NHL stats to acquire information on the current weather and the NHL scores from the previous day. Note that the code for NHL scores only works for the 2019 playoffs. Personalized message is sent through Twilio Cloud Communications and requires a valid account and verified number to send from. Code can be hosted on PythonAnywhere or locally. Hosting on PythonAnywhere requires a paid account in order to use the NHL API as the free account only permits certain whitelisted websites.
